\chapter{Background and Theory}
This chapter should describe the theoretical background needed to understand and solve the problem. 
For instance, a description of the hardware platform or specific components involved in this assignment, definition of concepts that are important to understand the solution should be summarized here.
Add citations to show sources whenever appropriate, LaTeX and bibliography managers make this easy. For instance, ``I always thought something was fundamentally wrong with the universe'' \cite{adams1995hitchhiker}.
